 <ul><li> <p> 10/10 - today i started coding my personal website, and i made a functioning menubar. </p></li>

   <li> <p> 10/24 - today i changed the aesthetic of my personal website, and changed the background image of my homepage to a collage. </p></li>

   <li> <p> 10/24 - i also started my inspo page, and put down three of my favorite charities, and linked the images to the charity website. </p></li>

   <li><p>10/28 - today i added by person card to my projects page, but i want to personalize the projects page a little more so i think i'm going to do that today or tomorrow for homework. i'm also going to start coding my big project for the compsci lounge, and i'm really excited to make this project.</p></li>

   <li><p>11/4 - today i pushed all of my webiste pages, so now all of this is on the internet! my next step is to start my project for the cs lounge which is going to be an interactive drawing thing. </p></li>

   <li><p>11/7 - today i added descriptions and images to all of my projects on my projects page, and i'm going to add images to show people what each of my projects look like. i also learned how to push everything on my own, so now i can update my website more and more often. </p></li>
   
   <li><p>11/18 - today i put my fizzbuzz on my projects page, and i'm about to push it. later this week, i'm going to put my java script prototype function thing up. </p></li>

   <li><p>11/21 - my javascript prototype function does not work, but i am putting it on this website anyway, and when i get the chance i will debug it.</p></li>

   <li><p>12/1 - i started coding my final project for the room in javascript today, and it's really challenging but i basically made a div that clones itself which allows users to "draw" with said div. this is a very rough draft and it looks very rudementary, but hopefully soon i can have a more polished looking project.</p></li>

   <li><p>12/6 - today i coded a sliding bar in javascript which controls the amount of red, blue, and green, in specific colors so users can select what color they would like to draw with, but the program is a little bit faulty and does not work yet. the next thing i want to add is a canvas to create a border for the "drawing" tool, and i want to make my scrolling bars work.</p></li>

   <li><p>12/12 - today i am putting all of my projects on my projects page whether they are completed or not. my next steps are to refine my javscript array prototype, my fizzbuzz, and my drawing program. the main thing i want to work on is the drawing game as that is what i am most excited about.</p></li>

   <li><p>12/12 - i am trying to push everything and it is not working oops.</p></li>

   <li><p>12/16 - today i created a list of gift mockups that i want to follow through with. to see this mockup click <a href="mockup.html">here</a>.</p></li>

   <li><p>1/16 - i haven't really worked on anything in a while, but i'm playing around with my drawing javascript project, but i'm not making a lot of progress.</p></li>

   <li><p>2/3 - i haven't pushed my entries in a while, but i'm doing that now. i made a javascript code that makes hundreds of divs, and i'm currently working to make these divs move. </p></li>

   <li><p>2/13 - today i finished the valentine i made for caroline, and through doing this i remembered how to do a lot of the things that i forgot to do earlier this semester, and i did it without help which was really nice. it's a really simple thing, but i was able to put a gif in and a list, and color each div so it looked nice and it was really satisfying to have been able to do it myself. i am going to now put it on my projects page and push my website so caroline can see it tomorrow online. </p></li>

   <li><p>2/25 - today i started a code sketch inspired by jennifer dewalt. i started by making a javascript document with a div (green squre) that when you click and drag, it follows your mouse, and when you let go it drops. i used event listeners and variables to make this, and next week i want to add more style to it to have a more polished version of the codesketch. this project is linked on my projects page. </p></li>

   <li><p>3/4 - today i read through my javascript for my project to get a better understanding of what it is doing. what i have so far is a div that has the style of a green square with 100 by 100px, and in javascript i give it the controls so that when you hold down and drag the mouse, the square moves with your mouse accross the screen. so i created the function mousemove so that when i move the mouse the div follows. however, i also added the function mouseup which stops the div from following my mouse when the mouse is not held down the div no longer follows the mouse. my next step with this project is to add in the actual dinosaur, and make the eyes get bigger.</p></li>

   <li><p>4/19 - today our assignment was to listen to a podcast regarding how algorithms play into the criminal justice system. before listening to this podcast i did not believe that someone's past predicts their futures. i do think that is sadly the case for some people, but for a lot of other individuals it is not. i also do not think that someone's actions can be predicted by their peer group or demographic. again, i do beleive that this is the case for some people, but it is not a given, and is not something inevitable. i was not able to take notes during the podcast, but after listening what surprises me is that algorithsm are used to sntence people before a trial. it feels very dystopian and inhumane to have an algorithm determine someone's fate, and i didn't realize that this was something that happened. after listening to the podcast i stick with my previous claim, that someone's past does not predict their future. yes, society and expectations do shape what people do, and their future actions, but this is not a given, and there is always a way to change that/ </p></li>
   <li><p>5/4 - today i made a mother's day codesketch for my mom and i used a cute horse cartoon, and made a list of reasons why i love her. i'm going to add music and a few effects to make it more fun and festive, and then i'm going to push it. </p></li>

   <li><p>5/8 - today i worked on my food codesketch. my goal is to have a pizza that hovers over a tongue image and disappears. i used javascript to create an variable x which is "true", when the mouse has been clicked and is down over the pizza. i then created an event listener on the tongue that listened for the mouse to be moved because the mouse is the pizza once you click on it, and when x is true to take away the opacity of the pizza so it disappears. this has not worked yet, but hopefully will work in a little bit once i debug it. this project can be found on my projects page! </p></li>
